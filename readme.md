We are getting a lot of questions by email and Twitter. This way anyone can read the answer!

The goal here is to discuss the product roadmap, track suggestions, get direct answers from the [gmaster team](https://www.plasticscm.com/company/team.html)... anything.

Anything means *anything*. Personal questions. Licensing. Work. Code. Whatever.
